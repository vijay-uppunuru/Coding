Total possible bit string (either 0 or 1) of length n which don't have two contiguous zeroes in them:

we can generate a bit-string of length n from bit-strings of length n-1?

Valid bit-strings fall into 2 classes, ones that end with a “0” and ones that end	with a “1”. 
  
Ones that end in a “1” could be generated by adding a one to a valid bit-string	of any kind: a(n-1) ways.
  
Ones that end with a “0” came about by appending a smaller bit-string of length	n-1 that ended with a “1” 
(otherwise 2 zeros appear), which must have come	about in turn by appending a “1” to any valid bit-string of length n-2: a(n-2) ways.

Total: an = a(n-1) + a(n-2)  n>2.   a1 = 2, a2 = 3.

    2,3,5,8,13.....

But we know the fibonacci sequence is 1,1,2,3,5,8,13...

we could get the desired value for n by finding the (n+2)’th Fibonacci number % 10^9+7

Using iterative or recursive solution would be time consuming.
so we can use Matrix exponential or Fast doubling method or any other to calculate.
	
Multiplying two matrices takes O(K^3) time using standard method, so the overall time complexity to solve a linear recurrence is O(K^3 log N).
